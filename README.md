# About
The README.md Generator was created for the user to quickly be able to create a high-quality, profession README.md file. The README.md Generator was created using the command line application in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) given a set of prompts through [Inquirer's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/). The user is prompted with detailed questions that provide the README.md with a Table of Contents featuring the About, Installation, Usage, Contribution and Questions sections. The user is prompted for additional information including their Github Username, Email Address, and preference of Licensure. After the information is collected from the user, the markdown file is then written with Node.js's built in filesystem module (also known as the 'fs' module).
Please visit [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CzPWLf5dscZxKIJJqvdP-yWfrYn6Cyl9/view?usp=sharing) for a live demo, since all of the generator is made via the command line.
